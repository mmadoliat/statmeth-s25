## Extra Question

Follow the example we had in the classroom, find the $E(X)$ and $Var(X)$ based on (i) equations (2.1) and (2.2), and (ii) simulation for the following cases. Does (i) and (ii) give you the same result?

\(a\) $X\sim\chi^2(\nu=N+1)$, where $N\sim Poisson(\lambda)$.

\(b\) (Only for Graduate Students) $X\sim Binomial(n=Y, p=P)$, where $Y\sim Poisson(\lambda)$ and $P\sim Beta(\alpha, \beta)$.
